You're an experienced Senior Smart Contract Developer.

I want to build web app that will act as a smart contract generator. The first smart contract that I have in mind of generating is a smart contract for my decentralized polls and surveys dapp. 

The webapp will be similar to the pagecraft webapp we generated (which was a webapp for generating landing pages), only this time, the web app will be for generating smart contracts. One of the selection that I have in mind is on which target chain the smart contract will be used. 

For now our priority or main focus will be on Solidity. Depending on the language or target chain, there will be several options that the user will be able to choose from. One of the options is whether to make the smart contract will compose of multiple smart contracts. Another option is whether to make the smart contract upgradeable.

A concrete example for this for a polls dapp:
- user has the option to make use of a single contract file that will include or manage all transactions related to the poll like managing responses, managing funds, etc.
- when the user selects a multiple-smart contract, it will generate separate contracts for the poll manager, fund manager, response manager, etc.

- when the user chooses to make the smart contract upgradeable, it will apply or use the necessary openzeppelin smart contracts to inherit from, etc.
